# Smart Contract Challenge

### Setup a project and create a contract

DAIPool provides a service where people can deposit DAI and they will receive weekly rewards. Users must be able to take out their deposits along with the accrued rewards at any time. The DAIPool team will deposit those rewards into the contract each week.

Design and code a contract for DAIPool, take all the assumptions you need to move forward.

You can use any development tools you prefer: Hardhat, Truffle, Brownie.

### Deploy your contract

Deploy the contract to any Ethereum testnet of your preference. Keep record of the deployed address.

### Interact with the contract

Create a script to query the total amount of tokens held in the contract and the deposited rewards.

You can use any library you prefer: Ethers.js, Web3.js, Web3.py
