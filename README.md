# Smart Contract Challenge (#3)

### 1) Review a contract

The Graph Network uses a contract called **Curation** as part of the network incentives. Understand how it works, we will discuss about it during the challenge review.

The code is in this public repo: https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/contracts/curation/Curation.sol

### 2) Interact with a contract

Create scripts to perform the following actions using the Curation contract:

- Mint new tokens for a subgraph deployment.
- Query and print the defaultReserveRatio.
- Query and print the total amount of Graph Tokens held in the contract.
- Print a list of `Signalled()` events and its attributes emitted by the contract.

> You can use any library you prefer: Ethers.js, Web3.js, Web3.py, eth-brownie and choose any language like TypeScript or Python.

- Contracts are deployed in the Rinkeby Testnet. You will need Rinkeby ETH to send transactions.
- Additionally you will need Rinkeby GRT. Send us your Ethereum address and we will send you some.
